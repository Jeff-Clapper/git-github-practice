    <h1 id="hello">Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Practice for git merging. Maybe I will include some cloning practice as well</p>
    <p>I am now in my updates</p>
    <p> I am adding one line in main and two in updates and going to merge the conflict</p>
    <p> the initial merge went off without a hitch..... <b>cooleo</b>. Now we can see what happenss when there is a <span>confilt</span></p>
    <p> I have added two lines to update and one to main</p>
    <p> That seemed to have worked..... I accepted the changes in vs, added and then commited in main, then went to updates and merged. Not sure if that is what I was 
        supposed to do. </p>
    
    
    <p> I am adding this in github, then I am going to pull into my git repo.</p>
